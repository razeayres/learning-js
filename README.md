# My learning-js repository

This repository holds my training .js files. I created while attending to the course ["JavaScript Essential Training"](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/javascript-essential-training/), which is a [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/) course by [Morten Rand-Hendriksen](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/instructors/morten-rand-hendriksen/). **I do not hold complete authorship of every line of code in these files, they are just a few results from my training**.
